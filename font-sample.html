        <p class="ided">I have been to Yellowstone National Park, Awesomeness! (This is Georgia)</p>
        <p class="copy">Yellowstone National Park is one of the best parks in the world. I saw Buffalos, <br>
           I saw yellow stones. I stayed there for five days. This park was one of the best places I've ever been to. <br> 
           The great nature is always embracing people like me to have a breath in life to forget about the reality. <br>
           It takes me to somewhere I never imagine to be. (This is Times New Roman)<br></p>
        <p class="conclusion">Life is wonderful!!!</p>
